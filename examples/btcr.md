# Understanding BTCR 
BTCR is the Bitcoin Reference DID (Decentralized Identifier).

DIDs allow individuals and firms to create identifiers which are provably under their control, without relying on a central authority. The identifiers can be used for a variety of things

This tutorial will explain DIDs and BTCR DIDs in particular, with working code that you can interactively explore to deeply understand how they work. By the end, students will have created a BTCR DID, a DID Document, a BTCR based Verifiable Credential, and a DID BTCR library usable for prototyping applications.

We cover the following topics.
